  version:
    description: |
      The version of Staticcheck to use. Because new versions of
      Staticcheck introduce new checks that may break your build, it
      is recommended to pin to a specific version and to update
      Staticheck consciously.
    required: true

  min-go-version:
    description: |
      Minimum version of Go to support. This affects the diagnostics
      reported by Staticcheck, avoiding suggestions that are not
      applicable to older versions of Go.

      If unset, this will default to the Go version specified in your
      go.mod.
      
      See https://staticcheck.io/docs/running-staticcheck/cli/#go

      Let the action install a version of Go appropriate for building and running Staticcheck.
      If set to false, the action expects you to have installed Go already.
      The latest release of Staticcheck works with the last two minor releases of Go.
      The action itself requires at least Go 1.16.
